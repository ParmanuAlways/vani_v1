SPEAKER_01:  So, Erin, in your email you said you wanted to talk about the exam.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,439
SPEAKER_00:  Yeah, um, I've just never taken a class with so many different readings.

00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,860
SPEAKER_00:  I've managed to keep up with all the assignments, but I'm not sure how to... how to...

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,820
SPEAKER_02:  How to review everything?

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,940
SPEAKER_00:  Yeah. In other classes I've had, there's usually just one book to review, not three different books, plus all those other text excerpts and videos.
